# Websockets refresher

- Websockets - Full duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection
  - Vs REST API connections are persistent and stateful
  - Client connects to the server and server can interact with the client
  - Persistent Connection
    - Push data from Server to Client
    - And Push data from client to server

- Main benefit
  - Push data between the two in *real time*
